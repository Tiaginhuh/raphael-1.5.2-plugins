Overview
--------

Plugin for raphael.js that will draw grid set (resizable rectangle) on the canvas.

The set contains five objects. One raphael rectangle and four raphael circles (a circle sits on each corner of the rectangle).

Click and drag on any corner of the rectangle to resize, click on the perimeter or inside the rectangle to move it around.


Usage
-----

    - Initialize drag on the paper, only call this function once.
        
        paper.gridSet.init();

    - Draw the resizable set (create as many as you need).
    
        paper.gridSet.create(100,150,400,100,15);


Extra Info
----------

    - It is up to you to add the fill attribute to each element on the paper,
      otherwise drag will only work by clicking on the perimeter of the element.
